# Colors
Each folder listed here contains specific files in regards to Hyprland, Waybar, and Rofi.

These files contain variables with colors which are used in the aforementioned programs.

I've tried to name the variables as straight-forward...ly as possible, to ensure there is no confusion. Usually, the variable names are identical throughout the programs, like `highlight` or `bg`.

## Custom Themes
When creating your own themes, use the provided `template` folder to create your own theme.

I suggest creating a copy of the folder with the name of your theme, then editing each file to contain the hex/rgb values for each variable.

If you want to, you can also modify the `colorscheme` script found in `.local/bin`, and add your theme to the list. This is not necessary.
